                The base or father of programming languages is ‘ALGOL.’
                 It was first introduced in 1960. ‘ALGOL’ was used on a large basis in European countries.<br>
                  ‘ALGOL’ introduced the concept of structured programming to the developer community. In 1967, a new computer programming language was announced called as ‘BCPL’ 
                  <br>which stands for Basic Combined Programming Language. <br>
                  BCPL was designed and developed by Martin Richards, especially for writing system software. This was the era of programming languages. <br>
                  Just after three years, in 1970 a new programming language called ‘B’ was introduced by Ken Thompson that contained multiple features of ‘BCPL.’ <br>
                  This programming language was created using UNIX operating system at AT&T and Bell Laboratories.<br>
                   Both the ‘BCPL’ and ‘B’ were system programming languages.</b>
